Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. With that in mind, we will look and see what effect it played specifically on Logistical Stocks, ie. UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc. and weahter they are on the rise, fall, or have leveled off. 

# Datasets

I useed 3 seperate data sets here. One analyizing Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S., and two obtained using yFinance looking and specidic dates. I was able to test coorelations against the rise in cases/deaths and individual stock prices.
